/**
 * A helper to prevent accumulation of sequential async tasks.
 *
 * Imagine a mail man with the sole task of delivering letters. As soon as
 * a letter submitted for delivery, he drives to the destination, delivers it
 * and returns to his base. Imagine that during the trip, N more letters were submitted.
 * When the mail man returns, he picks those N letters and delivers them all in a
 * single trip. Even though N+1 submissions occurred, only 2 deliveries were made.
 *
 * The throttler implements this via the queue() method, by providing it a task
 * factory. Following the example:
 *
 * 		const throttler = new Throttler();
 * 		const letters = [];
 *
 * 		function deliver() {
 * 			const lettersToDeliver = letters;
 * 			letters = [];
 * 			return makeTheTrip(lettersToDeliver);
 * 		}
 *
 * 		function onLetterReceived(l) {
 * 			letters.push(l);
 * 			throttler.queue(deliver);
 * 		}

/**
 * A helper to delay execution of a task that is being requested often.
 *
 * Following the throttler, now imagine the mail man wants to optimize the number of
 * trips proactively. The trip itself can be long, so he decides not to make the trip
 * as soon as a letter is submitted. Instead he waits a while, in case more
 * letters are submitted. After said waiting period, if no letters were submitted, he
 * decides to make the trip. Imagine that N more letters were submitted after the first
 * one, all within a short period of time between each other. Even though N+1
 * submissions occurred, only 1 delivery was made.
 *
 * The delayer offers this behavior via the trigger() method, into which both the task
 * to be executed and the waiting period (delay) must be passed in as arguments. Following
 * the example:
 *
 * 		const delayer = new Delayer(WAITING_PERIOD);
 * 		const letters = [];
 *
 * 		function letterReceived(l) {
 * 			letters.push(l);
 * 			delayer.trigger(() => { return makeTheTrip(); });
